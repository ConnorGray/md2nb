`md2nb` is a command-line tool for converting [Markdown](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
files into [Wolfram Notebooks](https://wolfram.com/notebooks).

## Usage

`md2nb` is a command-line tool. After [installing `md2nb`](#installation), it can be used
to convert a `.md` file to a `.nb`:

```shell
$ md2nb <INPUT>.md <OUTPUT>.nb
```

For example, to convert this project's `README.md` file into a Wolfram Notebook, execute:

```shell
$ md2nb README.md README.nb
```

## Features

`md2nb` converts `.md` files into Wolfram `.nb` files.

Markdown constructs are converted into corresponding standard Wolfram Notebook
representations.

Most CommonMark features are supported, including:

* Text styles like emphasis and italics
* Links
* Headers
* Bulleted lists
* Code blocks
* Block quotes
* Tables
* Horizontal rules

Additionally, some Markdown features are converted into Wolfram Notebook representations
that are more interactive than typical rendered Markdown:

* Code blocks containing code written in a language supported by
  [`ExternalEvaluate`][ExternalEvaluate] will be converted to external language cells,
  which can be executed directly within the Wolfram Notebook.

## Examples

See the 'Kitchen Sink' example, which includes samples of all Markdown features
currently supported by `md2nb`.
